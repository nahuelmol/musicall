Sound waves propagates along the crust and are detected by different microphones installed in the surface.

### This application..
..will take the shot-frequency, information of the target being located, amount of recpetors dispersed, etc.
From that input an wave image is generated as an output. This way different dimensiones and how diposed a body is underground can be proved, simulating varied situations. 

### Goals

* Practice tridimentional wave propagation
* Assess travel trayectories
* Expose how undergorund rock properties influence wave's traveling

### Tools
It's easier to deploy it as a web application.

* Django as the backend framework
* Render(amazon) as the web host
* waitress (the server) at first place
* Docker for virtualization
* Python and its army of libraries for data analysis and seg files management
